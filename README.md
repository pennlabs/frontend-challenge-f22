# Penn Labs Frontend Challenge

> If you have already done this challenge, there's a [section below](#repeat-applicants) specifically for you.

The frontend challenge for this semester is to build a product called Penn Course Cart in React! The goal of this challenge is for you to demonstrate:

1. An eye for building intuitive, feature-rich user interfaces
2. Ability to build products with minimal direction
3. Ability to work within a set timeline

More concretely, you will build an interface where users can explore computer science courses added at Penn, can add them to a cart, and checkout.

### Getting started

- Copy this repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the green "use this template" button. Make sure you create a **private repository**
  - You'll have to make a GitHub account if you don't already have one :stuck_out_tongue:
- [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the repository you just made to your own computer:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:{USERNAME}/frontend-challenge.git
  ```
- Make sure that you [have Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- `cd` into the cloned directory and run either `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run dev`

### Features

1. **Explore courses**

   - If you view `src/components/Courses.js`, you'll see that it is rendering _some_ of the courses data from `src/data/courses.json`
   - What you need to do is design a more robust way to display this courses information. You should display all information contained in the JSON--though put some thought into how to go about doing this.
     - For example, you might only want to show the description once the user clicks on the course.

2. **Add courses to your cart**

   - A user should be able to add a subset of these courses to their cart.
     - The user should not be able to add more than 7 courses to their cart.
   - When a user adds a course, this addition should be reflected in:
     1. How that cart is rendered
     2. How that course is rendered
     - For example, there should not still be a button to add that course to the cart, and maybe the text should be grayed out.

3. **View cart and checkout**

   - The user should be able to click a button to view their cart.
     - If the cart has no items in it, tell the user that their cart is empty.
     - If the cart has courses it in, display the courses and relevant information about them.
   - When the user is satisfied with their course cart, they should be able to "checkout"
     - This will either take the user to a new page containing (or will display on the same page) a "receipt" containing the courses which they checked out with.

4. **Additional features**

   - Feel free to add other features as well! Here are some ideas:
     - Big bonus if you integrate other data (course times, when they're offered, etc.)
       - A great resource is the [Penn Labs API](https://github.com/pennlabs/labs-api-server)
         ```
         fetch(https://api.pennlabs.org/registrar/search?q=cis-110)
         ```
     - Add animations for adding and viewing courses and the cart
     - Let users rank courses in order of preference
     - Take advantage of a [linter](https://eslint.org)
     - Allow users to filter and sort courses by different metrics

### Additional tips

- For styling, use whatever you want:

  - CSS frameworks (Bulma, Bootstrap)
  - CSS files (or SCSS)
  - CSS-in-JS
  - `styled-components`
  - ...

- For state management:

  - Vanilla react state and props
  - Redux
  - ...

- For navigation:
  - React Router
  - ...

### Repeat applicants

First off, thanks so much for your continued interest in Labs. We've accomplished a lot in the past year and have plans for more great products and features which need new developers to tackle them—so fingers crossed!

At Labs we don't just build new products, we also maintain legacy code bases and year over year push out new and improved versions. [Penn Course Review](https://penncoursereview.com) and the [Common Funding Application](https://penncfa.com) are two great examples.

That said, please note the differences between the current challenge and previous challenge, as we constantly update our challenge between semesters in accordance with the submissions we review and applicants' feedback. In line with this, we want you to take your submission from when you last applied, update your code, and take it to the next level with new features and data. Be deliberate with your implementation decisions, architecture, and documentation such that if someone else opens your code 6 months from now they'll be able to pick up right where you left off. We're excited to see what you come up with.
